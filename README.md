#Zomato Restaurant Clustering and Sentiment Analysis

The project aims to analyze Zomato restaurant data in India using unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically clustering and sentiment analysis. Zomato is a popular restaurant aggregator and food delivery platform in India, offering a wide range of cuisines and dining options. By analyzing this data, we can gain valuable insights into customer sentiments and preferences, as well as help both customers and the company make informed decisions.
The first step of the project involves collecting and preprocessing the Zomato restaurant data, which includes cleaning the data and extracting relevant features such as restaurant names, cuisines, cost, ratings, and reviews. Next, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of restaurants across different cities, cuisines, and cost ranges. Visualization techniques are used to identify patterns and insights in the data.
For sentiment analysis, we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiments of customer reviews. Sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) are assigned to each review, allowing us to understand customer opinions and feedback. Additionally, we cluster the Zomato restaurants into different segments based on features like cuisine, cost, ratings, and sentiment scores. Clustering algorithms such as KMeans are applied to group similar restaurants together.

The project also includes visualizing the clusters using scatter plots and other techniques to provide a clear understanding of the restaurant segments. Insights and recommendations are derived from the analysis, including recommendations for customers to find the best restaurants in their locality and suggestions for the company to improve and grow in areas where they may be lacking.
Overall, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the Indian food industry, help customers make informed dining choices, and assist the company in enhancing its services and offerings.
